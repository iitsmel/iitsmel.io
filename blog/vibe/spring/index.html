        <h2>My First Interview For Front-End Intern</h2>
        <p>It all begins in August 2019.I met a very friendly engineer at COSCUP(Conference for Open Source Coders) and started my journey of pursuing my dreams. 
        He was one of the speakers at the conference. He told audiences that we could ask for his contact if we were interested in sending applications to GSoC(Google Summer of Code). 
        So I asked for his contact and started to chat with him. Several months later, I submitted my first application as a computer science student. 
        Long story short, I didn't become one of the students that participated in GSoC 2019.
        </p>
        <p>Time flies, in October 2020, I participated in NASA SPACE APP CHALLENGE. 
        I was supposed to help my teammates with the back-end of the satellite tracker website we build. 
        However, I was not familiar with building a website at all. I was crushed by the disappointment of myself. 
        So I started to learn how to build a website. Spent about a whole week building my website. 
        Gosh, I spent so much time finally get it done. When I say "a week", it's like literally 18 hours per day.
        </p>
        <p>On the 17th of February 2021, I submitted my resume for a front-end intern position and got an interview opportunity. 
        Well, "This sounds like an encouraging story", you may think. Welp, no, my first interview did not go as I expected. It was rather tragic. 
        I was being interviewed hours ago. The interviewer was so nice to me but I was too nervous to answer anything. 
        My mind jammed like a blueberry jam. I can not focus on anything after the interview. I just can not believe what I did. 
        The only coding test he asked for was to compare elements in a single array using JavaScript with two example arrays. 
        It was the nicest thing someone can ask on a coding test. It was elementary level. Though, my jammed brain thought he meant to compare those two arrays. 
        I still can not believe that was my first thought. 
        </p>
        <p>So, what's next? I think I might start using JavaScript to write LeetCode and head back to my weather side project. 
        It was a complete failure to me. But it was worth it. Thank you, the front-end developer, for interviewing me. 
        Most importantly, thank you, the talent acquisition, for arranging my interview and patiently replied to all my emails.
